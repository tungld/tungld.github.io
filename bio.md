## brief biography 

Tung Duc Le is a researcher of the Systems group in TRL and working on
optimizations for AI systems. He had involved in the IBM PowerAI software
product since its inception in 2016, and did optimizations for Caffe and
Tensorflow deep learning frameworks. He was the author of Tensorflow Large
Model Support in IBM PowerAI, which allowed training very large deep learning
models on Power machines with 3 to 4 times faster than x86 machines. Since
2019, he has been working on Deep Learning Compiler for Z systems. He got Ph.D.
from National Institute of Informatics, Japan in 2016 with major of systematic
program transformation. His interest includes systematic methods to program
optimizations. He is an ACM Senior Member.
