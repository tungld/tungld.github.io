## about me
___________

I am a researcher at [IBM Research - Tokyo](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/tokyo). My main focus lies
in the intersection of deep learning, compiler and high performance computing.

Just in case, one may be interested in my [education](education.md) as well as [work history](work-history.md).

## research
___________
I really like the beauty of [the algebra of programming](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Programming-Prentice-hall-International-Computer/dp/013507245X)
and would like to apply it for systematically optimizing parallel programs in high performance computing and deep learning.
