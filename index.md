## About me
___________

I am currently a researcher at IBM Research - Tokyo. My main focus lies
in the intersection of deep learning, compiler and high performance
computing.

## Research
___________
I really like the beauty of [the algebra of programming](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Programming-Prentice-hall-International-Computer/dp/013507245X)
and would like to apply it for systematically optimizing parallel programs in high performance computing and deep learning.
