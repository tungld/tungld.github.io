* <<aboutme_mark>>About me
I am currently a researcher at IBM Research - Tokyo. My main focus lies in the intersection of deep learning, compiler and high performance computing.

I really like the beauty of [[https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Programming-Prentice-hall-International-Computer/dp/013507245X][the algebra of programming]] and would like to apply it for systematically optimizing parallel programs in high performance computing and deep learning.
