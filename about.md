---

I graduated in computer science
at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](http://hust.edu.vn) in 2007,
then got the Master degree there in 2010. I obtained a Ph.D. degree from
SOKENDAI in 2016 while working
at [National Institute of Informatics (NII)](http://nii.ac.jp/) under the
advice of Professor Zhenjiang Hu. My Ph.D. thesis focused on systematic
programming methods for big graphs. After that, I moved
to [IBM Research - Tokyo](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/tokyo/) as a
postdoctoral researcher. From 2017, I am a researcher at IBM Research - Tokyo.
